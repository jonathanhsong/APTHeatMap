# APTHeatMap
Policy Project to experiment with heatmaps

This project was made to demonstrate my ability to use Twitter and Gmaps api as well as my ability to understand
how to use the pandas library. This is a very small project and hope to develop it further just as an exercise. 

Please note that this was run in as a Jupyter Notebook so some of the comment formatting may look off. 

Also use your own access info for twitter. I sanitized the API keys in this code. 

A couple of things I want to improve: 
  -The way that the strings are being read without stripping may have allowed for a miscounting of exploits used
  -Categorize TTPs such that if RAT in key: exploit put it under Remote Access Trojan etc
  -Try to scrape the living google doc so that it will automatically update and feed the map
    -Maybe do this with twitter feeds from select intel agencies.
